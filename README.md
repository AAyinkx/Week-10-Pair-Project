## Issues we came accross with the ASCII Package

- When you have many components using the same package on one page the fonts can overwrite eachother.
- Noticed that the order of the properties affected how the display of the page works
- It doesn’t work well with emoji’s (its scattered or distorted)
- Animation charactors DO NOT work with the animation going "right" (left to right)

## Positives with the ASCII package

- Its compatible with next.js as its a new package (7 months old)
- Its compatible with tailwind
- Easy to use both the package and the initial installation
- The repo for the package explained the customisation very well

## Here are some fun ASCII characters you can have a play with:

- You can use these in the 'animationCharacters' property e.g

`animationCharacters: "❤",`

## Reflection

- It was nice working at a much slower pace than our usual assignments. This allowed us to explore and revisit previous topics such as using git(Git pull, git branch, merging and conflicts)
- Experimenting with a different package and something we're not used to was pretty fun!!
